  <h1>My name is James McCaw and I'm 21 years old. I play electric guitar and video games for fun in my spare time. 
    I have been working at Dunkin Donuts for almost 2 years now. 
    Dunkin isn't always the most fun place to work at, but my co-workers help me make it work.
    Now, I've decided to learn how to code because I have the ability to do so and I want to be successful with it.
